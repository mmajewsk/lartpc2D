* TODO
- [X] Read research log, and readme and find interesting links or topics
- [-] Compile list of interesting things to read
- [ ] Search for more things
- [ ] Read and describe each one

* Things read
** Emergence and Autocurricula
Links:
 - https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use/ - Openai Hide and seek
 - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.00742.pdf - "Autocurricula and the Emergence

   Intelligence Research" general description of autocurricula
 - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07528.pdf - "emergent tool use from multi-agent
autocurricula"  openai Hide and seek paper
*Emergence* - when strategies develop on their own with the RL
*Autocurricula* - the process where strategies are emerging
