  key concepts for reinforcement learning

** Markov...
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process - WMarkov Decision
  Process: Wikipedia article:
*Markov Decision Process* A probabilistic process (stochastic), meaning that it
 describes [S,A,Pa,Ra], such that Pa(s,s')==Pr(St+1=s'|st=s,at=a) probability
 that action {a}a in state {s}s at time {t}t will lead to state {s'}s' at time {t+1}t+1,
*Partially observable Markov decision process* is MDP but you cannot observe
 fully the underlying state

** Curriculum

  Curriculum for Reinforcement Learning - best blogpost
*By Wikipedia: Curriculum* DescriptionIn education, a curriculum is broadly
 defined as the totality of student experiences that
*Curriculum in RL* means setting up task in order i.e. more and more difficult, so
 this means that
*anit-curriculum* means easier and easier tasks
Usually some worse model is used to asses the curriculum
*Teacher-Guided Curriculum* So two kinda agents, teacher and student, teacher
 learns how to pick a task for the student, so that the student learns better
*Curriculum through Self-Play* This means that agents are playing between
 themselves to achieve ever growing difficulty of curriculum

** Emergence and Autocurricula

 - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.00742.pdf - "Autocurricula and the Emergence
   of Innovation from Social Interaction: A Manifesto for Multi-Agent
   Intelligence Research" general description of autocurricula
 - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07528.pdf - "emergent tool use from multi-agent
autocurricula"  openai Hide and seek paper
*Emergence* - when strategies develop on their own with the RL
*Autocurricula* - the process where strategies are emerging

** A2C - Actor Critic methods

  really good article presentic advantage A2C along a solution fort cartpole
*Actor - Critic*
There are two networks, one estimates a value response from the network, the other

** ACKTR - Actor Critic using Kronecker-Factored Trust Region (ACKTR)

variation on a2c, possibly better
** Deep Reinforcement learning

that cartpole example

** MCTS - Monte Carlo Tree Search
- https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search
This is probably the best explanation.
Start at root tree of decision.
Select nodes at random.
If you find leaf, make a simulation.
Update the count of win/loses at each node.
Repeat until some constraint.
Pick next action based on some criteria.

** Deep Recurent Q-Networks
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.06527.pdf DRQN

** Normalization of the rewards
- https://medium.com/@thechrisyoon/deriving-policy-gradients-and-implementing-reinforce-f887949bd63 -
this is about implementing REINFORCE, but there is quote from Karpathy about
normalisation.
#+NAME: karpathy
- http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/ - the source of the quote
- https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02438 - referenced source of the normalisation

** Stochastic Policy
*Stochastic* having a random probability distribution or pattern that may be
analysed statistically but may not be predicted precisely.
** Temporal Difference
- https://medium.com/@violante.andre/simple-reinforcement-learning-temporal-difference-learning-e883ea0d65b0

** Weighed map - mean frequency balancing
- https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/284265/understanding-median-frequency-balancing
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4734.pdf

- https://github.com/kwotsin/TensorFlow-ENet/blob/master/get_class_weights.py
This was employed in the code training categorisation.

** Multi-task learning
- https://ruder.io/multi-task/ a good short overview
** AlphaGo Zero
Uses MCTS to traing policy and value network.
** Search for Multi-task reinforcement learning
*** https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.08162.pdf not fully read this focuses on meta learning and casual reasoning
*** https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rkgpv2VFvr not fully read but kind of theoritical
